Technical Due Diligence (TDD) Document: Stranded Asset Analysis for Wealth and Retail Banking Mortgages
Document Version: 1.0
Date: July 19, 2025
Author: [Your Name/Department]
1. Executive Summary
This document provides a comprehensive Technical Due Diligence (TDD) of the Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) developed for Standard Chartered Bank’s (SCB) Wealth and Retail Banking (WRB) mortgage portfolio. The SAA is a critical tool designed to quantify the bank's exposure to climate-related physical risks, specifically identifying mortgage-backed properties at risk of becoming "stranded assets" due to increasing climate event frequency and intensity. This analysis assesses potential complete erosion of value for properties in Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and India, which are particularly vulnerable to physical climate risks.
The SAA complements existing credit risk models, such as Property Price Index (PPI) haircuts, by explicitly capturing tail risk events where individual properties may lose their entire economic value rather than experiencing general devaluation. The output of this analysis is applied as a management adjustment to Expected Credit Loss (ECL) and Loan Impairment (LI) to ensure robust climate risk provisioning.
The methodology involves: (1) identifying properties exposed to "Extreme" acute (Flood and Storm) or chronic (Sea Level Rise under RCP 8.5) risks; (2) applying specific mitigant criteria such as flood defense capabilities, property age, property type, and insurance coverage; and (3) quantifying the "complete erosion of value" for identified stranded properties. The analysis identifies approximately 2.16% of the Group WRB mortgage portfolio (by outstanding balance) as exposed to stranding, with significant concentrations in Hong Kong and Korea. The impact is phased, with material losses projected from 2041 onwards under the Current Policies scenario, aligning with the long-term nature of climate change.
This document serves as the formal DRR3 registration for the Stranded Asset Analysis, adhering to Standard Chartered Bank's stringent requirements for model documentation clarity, reproducibility, and robust assumptions. It is designed to be self-contained and understandable by suitably qualified parties, including external auditors and regulators.
1.1 Background
Standard Chartered Bank recognizes climate change as a significant financial risk. As part of its comprehensive climate risk management framework, the bank has developed the Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) to assess the specific impact of physical climate risks on its Wealth and Retail Banking (WRB) mortgage portfolio. This analysis focuses on residential mortgages across key markets: Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and India, which have been identified as particularly vulnerable to climate-related physical impacts.
1.2 Purpose of this document
The primary purpose of this document is to provide comprehensive Technical Due Diligence (TDD) for the Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA). This TDD serves to:
 * Detail the methodology, assumptions, data sources, and limitations of the SAA.
 * Ensure the analysis is transparent, reproducible, and understandable to a suitably qualified party, including internal and external auditors/regulators, in line with DRR3 requirements.
 * Document the rationale for management adjustments to ECL and LI based on the SAA's findings.
 * Support ongoing maintenance and potential future modifications of the SAA.
1.3 Use Cases
The Stranded Asset Analysis is primarily used for:
 * Climate Risk Stress Testing (CRST): Informing the bank's climate stress testing exercises (e.g., HKMA CRST 2023-24) by providing a quantitative estimate of severe, tail-risk losses due to physical climate impacts on mortgage collateral.
 * Risk Appetite Setting: Contributing to the formulation of the bank's climate-related risk appetite by highlighting specific concentrations of severe physical climate risk.
 * Strategic Decision-Making: Informing business strategy, lending policies, and portfolio management decisions in high-risk geographies.
 * Regulatory Compliance: Addressing regulatory expectations for robust assessment and management of climate-related financial risks.
 * Internal Risk Management: Enhancing the bank's internal understanding of granular climate risk exposures beyond traditional credit risk models.
1.4 DQM registration as DRR3
This document serves as the formal registration of the Stranded Asset Analysis under the bank's Documentation Review and Readiness Requirement 3 (DRR3) framework. DRR3 ensures that technical documentation, particularly for models and analytical tools, is clear, unambiguous, self-contained, and provides sufficient detail for independent understanding, maintenance, and change by suitably qualified parties. All specialized terms, abbreviations, and notations are clearly defined.
2. DQM DEVELOPMENT DESIGN
2.1 Statement of Purpose & Success Criteria
2.1.1 The business problem
Traditional credit risk models and property price index (PPI) haircuts, while capturing general property devaluation, may not adequately capture the localized, severe, tail-risk events where individual properties become uninhabitable or unusable due to extreme physical climate risks. This creates a gap in assessing the complete erosion of collateral value, which could lead to underestimated exposures in vulnerable portfolios.
2.1.2 The proposed solution
The proposed solution is the development and implementation of the Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA). This analysis provides a methodology to systematically identify mortgage properties at "Extreme" risk from specific physical climate perils (Flood, Storm, Sea Level Rise) and, after accounting for mitigants, quantifies the "complete erosion of value" for such identified properties. These quantified impacts are then applied as a direct management adjustment to ECL/LI.
2.1.3 The success criteria to meet the business problem
The success of the Stranded Asset Analysis is determined by its ability to:
 * Quantify Exposure: Provide a clear, auditable quantification of outstanding loan balances associated with properties identified as stranded assets within the WRB mortgage portfolio.
 * Inform Management Adjustments: Generate reliable figures for management adjustments to ECL/LI that reflect the material impact of tail physical risks.
 * Enhance Risk Understanding: Improve the bank's understanding of specific, granular exposures to physical climate risks, supplementing existing portfolio-level models.
 * Regulatory Alignment: Support compliance with climate risk stress testing requirements from regulators (e.g., HKMA CRST).
 * Reproducibility: Be fully documented such that a suitably qualified third party can independently replicate the analysis and its results.
2.2 Model Output, Usage, Scope and Operating Boundaries
 * Model Output: The primary output is a monetary value representing the aggregate outstanding loan balance of identified stranded assets, categorized by geography and risk type (acute/chronic), and phased over the projection horizon.
 * Usage: The output is currently used as a management adjustment applied to ECL/LI for "current policies" and "tail physical risk" scenarios. It serves to inform risk provisioning, capital adequacy discussions, and strategic planning.
 * Scope: The analysis covers residential mortgage portfolios in Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and India. It specifically assesses Flood Risk, Storm Risk (acute), and Sea Level Rise (chronic). Heat stress is considered for transition risk, and precipitation stress is deemed implicitly covered by flood/storm risk and thus not directly considered for stranding quantification.
 * Operating Boundaries: The analysis relies on available granular property data and external climate risk vendor data. Limitations due to data availability and usability across markets are acknowledged and documented (see Section 7.1.1). The impact is applied from 2041 for "current policies" and chronic risks in "tail physical risk" scenarios, and from 2024 for acute risks in "tail physical risk" scenarios.
2.3 User Feedback in the Design Process
The development of the Stranded Asset Analysis methodology and its key assumptions (e.g., mitigant thresholds, phasing of impact) involved iterative feedback and discussions with an internal expert panel. This panel included representatives from Credit Risk, Real Estate Valuation, and the broader Climate Risk Working Group. This collaborative approach ensured the methodology reflects expert judgment and practical considerations within the bank's operations. The feedback loop was crucial in refining definitions, selecting appropriate thresholds, and validating the overall approach.
2.4 DQM Selection Process
The Stranded Asset Analysis is classified as a significant analytical tool underpinning management adjustments for climate risk. Its selection as a component requiring DRR3-level documentation is driven by its material impact on risk assessment, its reliance on complex external data and internal assumptions, and the increasing regulatory scrutiny on climate-related financial disclosures and stress testing. The choice to develop an "add-on" to ECL/LI, distinct from existing PPI haircuts, was a deliberate decision following comprehensive review of existing models and the specific nature of "stranded assets" (complete value erosion).
3. DQM Rating
The Stranded Asset Analysis, as a critical tool for quantifying climate-related financial risk and informing management adjustments, is subject to a formal review process within the bank's Data Quality Management (DQM) framework. While not a conventional regulatory model for capital calculation, its outputs are material to financial disclosures and stress testing. As such, it is classified for DRR3 documentation, implying a high standard of transparency, reproducibility, and control over its inputs, methodology, and outputs. The DQM rating process ensures the underlying data quality and the robustness of the methodology are assessed and continually monitored.
4. DQM INPUT DATA, MODEL METHODOLOGY & MODEL OUTPUT
4.1 DQM Input Data
The Stranded Asset Analysis relies on a combination of internal and external data sources. The quality and consistency of this input data are crucial for the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. Data availability and usability challenges across footprint markets are acknowledged and managed (see Section 7.1.1).
| Data Source Category | Specific Data/Provider | Purpose in SAA | Vintage/Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Internal Data | WRB Mortgage Portfolio Data (Credit Risk Systems) | Property location (address/coordinates), Loan-to-Value (LTV), collateral type, loan amount, outstanding balances, internal risk ratings, property age. This forms the basis for asset identification and financial impact calculation. | Quarterly/Monthly |
| Climate Risk Data | [Specific Provider for Flood/Storm Risk Maps, e.g., Moody's RMS, Verisk, other vendor if used] | Identification of properties in "Extreme" flood and storm risk categories, based on probabilistic models and historical event data. | Annually/As updated |
| Climate Scenario Data | Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) / IEA (International Energy Agency) | RCP 8.5 pathway data for Sea Level Rise projections up to 2050. Used to define the chronic risk exposure over the long term. | As published by IPCC/IEA |
| Flood Defense Data | [Specific Local Government/Public Works Data Source, e.g., Municipal Flood Defense SOP, Muniich Re Flood Defense SOP Score] | Information on flood defense infrastructure and their effectiveness ratings. Used for mitigating factor assessment based on the Muniich Re Flood Defense SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) score. | Annually/As updated |
| Property Specifics | [Internal Property Database/Valuation Reports, or external property data provider] | Detailed property type (e.g., Standalone Buildings, Village Type Houses, Villas, Bungalows, Semi Detached properties) and construction year (pre/post 1970). Used for mitigating factor assessment. Due to unavailability of data capturing the floor of the property, "Property Type" is chosen as an alternative. | Ongoing/As available |
| Geographic Data | [GIS provider, e.g., Esri, Google Maps API] | Distance to coast calculation for Sea Level Rise chronic risk assessment. | As updated |
| Insurance Data | [Internal Insurance Policy Data, or external market data] | Current insurance coverage status and mandatory insurance requirements. Used for short-term mitigation assessment (until 2030). | Annually/As updated |
4.2 DQM Methodology
The Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) is conducted through a structured, multi-step process, designed to identify, assess, and quantify the potential impact of physical climate risks on the bank's mortgage portfolio. The methodology is documented to allow a suitably qualified party to independently replicate the model, tests, and results.
4.2.1 Processing BCRS File (N/A for direct SAA; data extracted from internal WRB Mortgage Portfolio Data)
The SAA directly extracts loan and property data from the bank's internal WRB Mortgage Portfolio Data systems. There is no direct "BCRS File" processing component specifically for the SAA; relevant data is aggregated from core credit risk systems.
4.2.2 CEM PD Overlays for Corporates (N/A)
This section is not applicable to the Stranded Asset Analysis for WRB Mortgages, which focuses on residential mortgage collateral rather than corporate exposures or Probability of Default (PD) overlays.
4.2.3 PD Extrapolation for clients not modelled by CEM (N/A)
This section is not applicable to the Stranded Asset Analysis for WRB Mortgages.
4.2.4 LGD Overlays for Corporates with Property Collateral (N/A)
This section is not applicable to the Stranded Asset Analysis for WRB Mortgages, as the SAA determines a direct "complete erosion of value" rather than an LGD overlay for corporates.
4.2.5 PD Overlays for Sovereigns modelled by Climate Adjusted Sovereign Model (N/A)
This section is not applicable to the Stranded Asset Analysis for WRB Mortgages.
4.2.6 PD Overlays for Sovereigns not modelled by Climate Adjusted Sovereign Model (N/A)
This section is not applicable to the Stranded Asset Analysis for WRB Mortgages.
4.2.7 PD Trajectory for Financial Institutions, FI... (N/A)
This section is not applicable to the Stranded Asset Analysis for WRB Mortgages.
4.2.8 Generating final Credit Risk Metrics like ECL, LI, RWA
The Stranded Asset Analysis directly generates a quantitative value representing the "complete erosion of value" for identified stranded properties. This value is applied as a direct add-on management adjustment to the bank's Expected Credit Loss (ECL) and Loan Impairment (LI) figures, specifically for "current policies" and "tail physical risk" scenarios. This approach directly impacts the credit risk metrics by increasing the provisioning for these tail climate risks. The SAA does not directly calculate Risk Weighted Assets (RWA).
4.3 Model Methodology (cont.)
4.3.1 Model Specification
The Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) model identifies properties at risk of becoming "stranded" based on their exposure to defined "Extreme" physical climate risks and the absence of specific mitigating factors. A "stranded asset" is precisely defined as a property expected to become uninhabitable and/or unusable due to climate-related physical risks, leading to a complete erosion of its economic value (100% loss).
The model operates in four key sequential steps:
4.3.1.1 Step 1: Asset Identification and Data Aggregation
 * Purpose: To compile all necessary property and loan-level data for the analysis.
 * Inputs: Internal WRB Mortgage Portfolio Data, Property Specifics (location, type, age).
 * Process: Extract, cleanse, and validate active mortgage loan accounts with associated property details (address, geo-coordinates, type, construction year, LTV, outstanding balance).
 * Outputs: Consolidated dataset of all WRB mortgage properties with relevant attributes.
4.3.1.2 Step 2: Climate Risk Exposure Assessment
 * Purpose: To categorize properties based on their exposure to "Extreme" physical climate risks.
 * Inputs: Consolidated property dataset, Climate Risk Data (Flood/Storm Maps), Climate Scenario Data (RCP 8.5 for Sea Level Rise), Geographic Data.
 * Process:
   * Acute Risk (Flood & Storm): Overlay property geo-coordinates with external vendor-provided "Extreme" flood and storm risk maps. A property is flagged if it falls within predefined "Extreme" risk zones.
     * Definition of "Extreme" Risk (Flood/Storm): [ACTION REQUIRED: Explicitly define what "Extreme" means for Flood and Storm risk. This must be a quantitative threshold from your source data. E.g., "Exposure to a 1-in-100 year flood event or a 100-year storm surge event, as defined by [Specific Climate Risk Data Provider]. This category represents events with a 1% annual chance of occurrence and a high potential for severe damage."]
   * Chronic Risk (Sea Level Rise): Flag properties with a distance to the nearest coastline of \\le 1 \\text{ km} under the IEA RCP 8.5 pathway up to 2050.
   * Exclusions: Heat Stress is not considered for direct stranding; Precipitation Stress is considered implicitly captured by flood/storm risk.
 * Outputs: Updated property dataset with flags for "Extreme" Flood Risk, "Extreme" Storm Risk, and Sea Level Rise Risk.
4.3.1.3 Step 3: Mitigant Assessment and Stranded Asset Criteria Application
 * Purpose: To apply defined mitigant criteria to identify properties truly at risk of becoming stranded assets.
 * Inputs: Property dataset with climate risk flags, Flood Defense Data (Muniich Re Flood Defense SOP Score), Property Specifics (age, type), Insurance Data.
 * Process: For properties identified with "Extreme" risk, apply the following mitigant criteria based on Table 2: Mitigants for different risk types:
   * Acute Risk Mitigants (Flood/Storm):
     * Flood Defense SOP: Properties with Muniich Re Flood Defense SOP score \\le 20 are at higher risk ("Poor Flood Defense").
     * Age of Property: Properties constructed prior to 1970 are at higher risk ("Old Properties").
     * Type of Property: "Vulnerable Property Types" (Standalone Buildings, Village Type Houses, Villas, Bungalows, Semi Detached) are at higher risk.
     * Insurance Benefits: 100% insurance benefits are considered only until 2030 in markets where it is mandatory. No insurance benefits are considered from 2031 onwards due to uncertainty.
   * Chronic Risk Mitigants (Sea Level Rise): Properties located "Near the coast" (distance \\le 1 \\text{ km}) are considered for stranding due to Sea Level Rise.
 * Stranded Asset Criteria: A property is stranded if it's exposed to "Extreme" Flood/Storm risk and fails any acute mitigant, OR it's exposed to Sea Level Rise (distance \\le 1 \\text{ km}).
 * Outputs: Filtered list of properties identified as "stranded assets."
4.3.1.4 Step 4: Impact Quantification and Management Adjustment
 * Purpose: To quantify the financial impact as a management adjustment to ECL/LI.
 * Inputs: List of identified stranded properties, outstanding loan balances.
 * Process: The outstanding loan balance of each identified stran

Technical Due Diligence (TDD) Document: Stranded Asset Analysis for Wealth and Retail Banking Mortgages
Document Version: 1.0

Author: [Your Name/Department]
1. Purpose and Scope
This document details the methodology and operational framework for the Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) conducted within the Wealth and Retail Banking (WRB) Credit Risk division of Standard Chartered Bank (SCB). The primary purpose of this SAA is to assess the bank's exposure to climate-related physical risks, specifically identifying mortgage-backed properties that are at risk of becoming "stranded assets" due to the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events and their long-term impacts.
The analysis focuses on residential mortgage portfolios within Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and India, which are particularly vulnerable to physical climate risks. The scope of this analysis covers:
 * Asset Class: Residential mortgages.
 * Climate Risks Assessed: Flood Risk, Storm Risk (acute risks), and Sea Level Rise (chronic risk). While Heat Stress and Precipitation Stress are acknowledged as critical components of physical climate risk, they are explicitly excluded from the direct calculation of stranded assets for reasons detailed in Section 3.2.2.
 * Time Horizon: The analysis considers the impact of climate risks for the current acute risk exposure and projected chronic risks up to 2050, with specific adjustments for stranded assets applied from 2041-2050.
 * Scenario: For chronic risks, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) is utilized as a conservative and high-impact scenario, representing a trajectory of high greenhouse gas emissions leading to significant climate impacts. For current acute risks, prevailing conditions are considered.
 * Objective: To quantify the potential "complete erosion of value" for properties identified as stranded assets and to incorporate these adjustments into the bank's credit risk assessment frameworks as management adjustments to the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) and Loan Impairment (LI).
This document serves as the Technical Due Diligence (TDD) for the Stranded Asset Analysis, ensuring compliance with internal DRR3 requirements for clarity, reproducibility, and robust model assumptions, allowing for independent understanding, maintenance, and change by suitably qualified parties.
2. Model Overview
The Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) is a component of Standard Chartered Bank's broader climate risk management framework. It is designed to capture specific, high-impact tail risk events that may not be fully addressed by existing portfolio-level risk assessment methodologies, such as Property Price Index (PPI) haircuts. While PPI haircuts address broad property devaluation due to physical climate risk, the SAA specifically identifies and quantifies the risk of individual properties losing their entire economic value and becoming uninhabitable or unusable.
The core concept is that certain properties, particularly those exposed to "Extreme" categories of physical climate risks (Flood, Storm, Sea Level Rise), are susceptible to becoming "stranded." A stranded asset, in this context, is explicitly defined as a property that is expected to become uninhabitable and/or unusable due to increased frequency and intensity of physical climate risk events, leading to a complete erosion of its market value.
The SAA methodology involves:
 * Identification: Identifying properties exposed to "Extreme" risk categories of Flood and Storm Risk (acute) and Sea Level Rise (chronic, under RCP 8.5 pathway to 2050). It has been observed that approximately 50% of the Mortgage book is exposed to "Extreme" Acute Risks (Flood or Storm) or Chronic Risks (Sea Level Rise).
 * Mitigant Assessment: Incorporating various mitigating factors such as flood defense capabilities, property age, property type, and insurance coverage. Only properties that are exposed to "Extreme" Acute Risks or Chronic Risks and simultaneously do not meet the specified mitigant criteria are identified as stranded assets.
 * Impact Quantification: Quantifying the "complete erosion of value" for identified stranded properties. This adjustment is applied as a direct "add-on" to ECL/LI. This approach is adopted in line with the scenario narrative, where the intensity and frequency of physical risk events are expected to materialize in the outer years, and for Tail Physical Risk scenarios.
This analysis aims to supplement existing risk models and provide a more granular view of potential severe losses from climate-related physical risks on the mortgage portfolio. It contributes to more informed strategic decision-making, risk provisioning, and aligns with the bank's climate risk management objectives.
3. Assumptions and Data Sources
This section outlines the key assumptions underpinning the Stranded Asset Analysis and details the data sources used. All assumptions are explicitly stated with their rationale and, where possible, supported by data or expert judgment, ensuring clarity and traceability as per DRR3 guidelines.
3.1. Model Assumptions
These assumptions are intrinsic to the design and operation of the SAA model itself.
 * Assumption 3.1.1: Definition of Stranded Assets for Mortgage Properties
   * Definition: A property is considered "stranded" if it is expected to become uninhabitable and/or unusable due to climate-related physical risks, leading to a complete erosion of its economic value (100% loss of value).
   * Rationale: This definition targets the most severe outcome of physical climate risk, representing a permanent and irrecoverable loss of utility and value. It distinctly separates stranding from general property devaluation, which is typically captured by other models like PPI haircuts. This aligns with the objective of capturing "tail risk events" that traditional portfolio-level models may not adequately capture.
   * Justification: This assumption simplifies the impact quantification by assuming a binary outcome (either fully valuable or completely valueless) for identified stranded assets. This provides a clear and unambiguous threshold for calculating management adjustments and ensures a conservative provisioning for severe outcomes, which is critical for climate stress testing.
 * Assumption 3.1.2: Applicability and Phasing of Management Adjustments
   * Definition: Adjustments for identified stranded assets are applied as management adjustments. These adjustments are specifically for the "current policies" scenario and "tail physical risk" scenarios only. For the "current policies" scenario, management adjustments for stranded assets due to both acute and chronic risks are applied from 2041. For the "tail physical risk" scenario, management adjustments for acute risks are applied from 2024, while chronic risks are applied from 2041.
   * Rationale: This approach ensures that the stranded asset impact is considered separately from baseline credit risk calculations and is specifically targeted at extreme climate risk scenarios. The phased application, particularly the later materialization of chronic risk impacts from 2041, is based on feedback received during expert panel discussions. It was agreed that more material losses may materialize in the outer years based on the profile of the cumulative rate of change in Global Mean Temperatures (GMT). While the "tail physical risk" narrative poses extreme shocks in the immediate short term (hence acute risks from 2024), chronic risks typically manifest as a gradual accumulation over an extended period.
   * Justification: This distinction in phasing allows the bank to explicitly account for climate-specific risks that are beyond the scope of conventional credit models, reflecting the long-term and progressive nature of chronic physical risks. It provides flexibility for future integration into other scenario analyses while providing a realistic temporal allocation of the impact in line with scientific understanding of climate change progression.
 * Assumption 3.1.3: Interaction with Property Price Index (PPI) Haircuts
   * Definition: PPI haircuts, derived from a methodology developed in collaboration with Imperial College London, are applied at a portfolio level. They address general property devaluation due to physical climate risk events (e.g., storm or flood risk). However, they do not explicitly capture the severe, localized, tail risk events such as individual properties becoming uninhabitable or unusable. Therefore, the stranded asset adjustments are considered as a distinct "add-on" to ECL/LI.
   * Rationale: This approach prevents double-counting of risk while ensuring comprehensive coverage of climate risk impacts. Stranding represents a distinct and more severe outcome (complete loss of value) than general price depreciation captured by PPI haircuts.
   * Justification: This clear distinction ensures that both systemic devaluation and extreme, localized asset destruction are accounted for in the risk assessment, providing a more complete and nuanced picture of climate risk exposure.
3.2. Contextual Assumptions
These assumptions relate to the broader economic, environmental, or regulatory context in which the SAA operates.
 * Assumption 3.2.1: Climate Scenario for Chronic Risks (Sea Level Rise)
   * Definition: For chronic risks, specifically Sea Level Rise, the RCP 8.5 pathway is used for projections up to 2050.
   * Rationale: RCP 8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), represents a "business-as-usual" or high-emissions scenario. This pathway assumes limited actions from global actors to reduce emissions, leading to a "hot world" scenario with severe physical risks and limited movement in concentration stabilization by 2050. This is considered a prudent and conservative choice for assessing long-term climate risk in a stress testing context, aligning with common practices in climate stress testing frameworks (e.g., HKMA CRST, BOE).
   * Justification: The selection of RCP 8.5 for chronic risks ensures that the bank's assessment of stranded assets accounts for a severe, but plausible, future climate trajectory. This helps to build resilience against worst-case scenarios and addresses regulatory expectations for robust climate risk assessments. The availability of robust scientific data for Sea Level Rise projections under the RCP 8.5 pathway further supports this choice.
 * Assumption 3.2.2: Exclusion of Heat Stress and Precipitation Stress from Direct Stranding Calculation
   * Definition: While Heat Stress and Precipitation Stress are critical components of physical climate risk, Heat Stress is considered for transition risk quantification in future analyses rather than for direct stranded asset calculation. Precipitation Stress is not considered for stranded assets, as its impact is implicitly captured by flood and storm risk assessments.
   * Rationale: This scope limitation is primarily due to methodological and data challenges in directly linking these perils to the specific outcome of "complete erosion of value" for mortgage collateral, as clearly defined for stranded assets. Heat stress primarily affects habitability, operational costs, and energy consumption, which may not directly lead to a 100% loss of property value in the same manner as inundation or structural damage from storms. Precipitation stress often exacerbates flood risk, making its direct impact inherently included in flood risk models.
   * Justification: This allows for a more streamlined and focused stranded asset methodology, concentrating resources on the most material and direct drivers of physical stranding as defined by the model. The bank's broader climate risk framework does consider these risks for other impact channels (e.g., operational risk, transition risk), and ongoing research and data development are being pursued to potentially integrate these into the SAA in future iterations if direct links to "complete erosion of value" become quantifiable.
 * Assumption 3.2.3: Exclusion of Insurance Benefits beyond 2030
   * Definition: Current insurance benefits are considered for markets where insurance is mandatory for flood and storm risk (e.g., Hong Kong, China, Australia, Netherlands) until 2030. From 2031 onwards, no insurance benefits are considered for stranded asset estimations.
   * Rationale: This decision reflects significant uncertainty around the future availability, affordability, and scope of insurance coverage in the face of escalating extreme climate events. Climate change disrupts the core principles on which insurance is built (quantifiable, diversified, and randomly occurring risks). Catastrophe risks, particularly flood risks, often do not meet these criteria, leading to issues like adverse selection and accumulation risk. Low demand for flood insurance can further reduce the size and diversity of the risk pool, leading to higher premiums and potentially market failure in the private insurance sector. Moreover, HKMA guidance (2023-24) explicitly states that banks should not assume any climate adaptation and mitigation measures (e.g., insurance coverage) in quantifying the impact under the Current Policies scenario, and renewal of existing insurance coverage after expiry should not be assumed. This aligns with findings from external reports (e.g., OECD report on Financial Management of Flood Risk discussing erosion in "Principles of Insurability," and BOE's papers on potential increases in flood insurance premia and difficulty in accessing finance for properties).
   * Justification: This conservative assumption mitigates the risk of underestimating exposure to stranded assets by not relying on uncertain future insurance coverage, particularly for the long-term tail risks that stranding addresses. This aligns with a prudent risk management approach and adheres to explicit regulatory guidance.

1. Purpose and Scope
This document details the methodology and operational framework for the Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) conducted within the Wealth and Retail Banking (WRB) Credit Risk division of Standard Chartered Bank (SCB). The primary purpose of this SAA is to assess the bank's exposure to climate-related physical risks, specifically identifying mortgage-backed properties that are at risk of becoming "stranded assets" due to the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-related events and their long-term impacts.
The analysis focuses on residential mortgage portfolios within Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and India, which are particularly vulnerable to physical climate risks. The scope of this analysis covers:
 * Asset Class: Residential mortgages.
 * Climate Risks Assessed: Flood Risk, Storm Risk (acute risks), and Sea Level Rise (chronic risk). While Heat Stress and Precipitation Stress are acknowledged as critical components of physical climate risk, they are explicitly excluded from the direct calculation of stranded assets for reasons detailed in Section 3.2.2.
 * Time Horizon: The analysis considers the impact of climate risks for the current acute risk exposure and projected chronic risks up to 2050, with specific adjustments for stranded assets applied from 2041-2050.
 * Scenario: For chronic risks, the International Energy Agency (IEA) Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5) is utilized as a conservative and high-impact scenario, representing a trajectory of high greenhouse gas emissions leading to significant climate impacts. For current acute risks, prevailing conditions are considered.
 * Objective: To quantify the potential "complete erosion of value" for properties identified as stranded assets and to incorporate these adjustments into the bank's credit risk assessment frameworks as management adjustments to the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) and Loan Impairment (LI).
This document serves as the Technical Due Diligence (TDD) for the Stranded Asset Analysis, ensuring compliance with internal DRR3 requirements for clarity, reproducibility, and robust model assumptions, allowing for independent understanding, maintenance, and change by suitably qualified parties.
2. Model Overview
The Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) is a component of Standard Chartered Bank's broader climate risk management framework. It is designed to capture specific, high-impact tail risk events that may not be fully addressed by existing portfolio-level risk assessment methodologies, such as Property Price Index (PPI) haircuts. While PPI haircuts address broad property devaluation due to physical climate risk, the SAA specifically identifies and quantifies the risk of individual properties losing their entire economic value and becoming uninhabitable or unusable.
The core concept is that certain properties, particularly those exposed to "Extreme" categories of physical climate risks (Flood, Storm, Sea Level Rise), are susceptible to becoming "stranded." A stranded asset, in this context, is explicitly defined as a property that is expected to become uninhabitable and/or unusable due to increased frequency and intensity of physical climate risk events, leading to a complete erosion of its market value.
The SAA methodology involves:
 * Identification: Identifying properties exposed to "Extreme" risk categories of Flood and Storm Risk (acute) and Sea Level Rise (chronic, under RCP 8.5 pathway to 2050). It has been observed that approximately 50% of the Mortgage book is exposed to "Extreme" Acute Risks (Flood or Storm) or Chronic Risks (Sea Level Rise).
 * Mitigant Assessment: Incorporating various mitigating factors such as flood defense capabilities, property age, property type, and insurance coverage. Only properties that are exposed to "Extreme" Acute Risks or Chronic Risks and simultaneously do not meet the specified mitigant criteria are identified as stranded assets.
 * Impact Quantification: Quantifying the "complete erosion of value" for identified stranded properties. This adjustment is applied as a direct "add-on" to ECL/LI. This approach is adopted in line with the scenario narrative, where the intensity and frequency of physical risk events are expected to materialize in the outer years, and for Tail Physical Risk scenarios.
This analysis aims to supplement existing risk models and provide a more granular view of potential severe losses from climate-related physical risks on the mortgage portfolio. It contributes to more informed strategic decision-making, risk provisioning, and aligns with the bank's climate risk management objectives.
3. Assumptions and Data Sources
This section outlines the key assumptions underpinning the Stranded Asset Analysis and details the data sources used. All assumptions are explicitly stated with their rationale and, where possible, supported by data or expert judgment, ensuring clarity and traceability as per DRR3 guidelines.
3.1. Model Assumptions
These assumptions are intrinsic to the design and operation of the SAA model itself.
 * Assumption 3.1.1: Definition of Stranded Assets for Mortgage Properties
   * Definition: A property is considered "stranded" if it is expected to become uninhabitable and/or unusable due to climate-related physical risks, leading to a complete erosion of its economic value (100% loss of value).
   * Rationale: This definition targets the most severe outcome of physical climate risk, representing a permanent and irrecoverable loss of utility and value. It distinctly separates stranding from general property devaluation, which is typically captured by other models like PPI haircuts. This aligns with the objective of capturing "tail risk events" that traditional portfolio-level models may not adequately capture.
   * Justification: This assumption simplifies the impact quantification by assuming a binary outcome (either fully valuable or completely valueless) for identified stranded assets. This provides a clear and unambiguous threshold for calculating management adjustments and ensures a conservative provisioning for severe outcomes, which is critical for climate stress testing.
 * Assumption 3.1.2: Applicability and Phasing of Management Adjustments
   * Definition: Adjustments for identified stranded assets are applied as management adjustments. These adjustments are specifically for the "current policies" scenario and "tail physical risk" scenarios only. For the "current policies" scenario, management adjustments for stranded assets due to both acute and chronic risks are applied from 2041. For the "tail physical risk" scenario, management adjustments for acute risks are applied from 2024, while chronic risks are applied from 2041.
   * Rationale: This approach ensures that the stranded asset impact is considered separately from baseline credit risk calculations and is specifically targeted at extreme climate risk scenarios. The phased application, particularly the later materialization of chronic risk impacts from 2041, is based on feedback received during expert panel discussions. It was agreed that more material losses may materialize in the outer years based on the profile of the cumulative rate of change in Global Mean Temperatures (GMT). While the "tail physical risk" narrative poses extreme shocks in the immediate short term (hence acute risks from 2024), chronic risks typically manifest as a gradual accumulation over an extended period.
   * Justification: This distinction in phasing allows the bank to explicitly account for climate-specific risks that are beyond the scope of conventional credit models, reflecting the long-term and progressive nature of chronic physical risks. It provides flexibility for future integration into other scenario analyses while providing a realistic temporal allocation of the impact in line with scientific understanding of climate change progression.
 * Assumption 3.1.3: Interaction with Property Price Index (PPI) Haircuts
   * Definition: PPI haircuts, derived from a methodology developed in collaboration with Imperial College London, are applied at a portfolio level. They address general property devaluation due to physical climate risk events (e.g., storm or flood risk). However, they do not explicitly capture the severe, localized, tail risk events such as individual properties becoming uninhabitable or unusable. Therefore, the stranded asset adjustments are considered as a distinct "add-on" to ECL/LI.
   * Rationale: This approach prevents double-counting of risk while ensuring comprehensive coverage of climate risk impacts. Stranding represents a distinct and more severe outcome (complete loss of value) than general price depreciation captured by PPI haircuts.
   * Justification: This clear distinction ensures that both systemic devaluation and extreme, localized asset destruction are accounted for in the risk assessment, providing a more complete and nuanced picture of climate risk exposure.
3.2. Contextual Assumptions
These assumptions relate to the broader economic, environmental, or regulatory context in which the SAA operates.
 * Assumption 3.2.1: Climate Scenario for Chronic Risks (Sea Level Rise)
   * Definition: For chronic risks, specifically Sea Level Rise, the RCP 8.5 pathway is used for projections up to 2050.
   * Rationale: RCP 8.5 (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5), as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), represents a "business-as-usual" or high-emissions scenario. This pathway assumes limited actions from global actors to reduce emissions, leading to a "hot world" scenario with severe physical risks and limited movement in concentration stabilization by 2050. This is considered a prudent and conservative choice for assessing long-term climate risk in a stress testing context, aligning with common practices in climate stress testing frameworks (e.g., HKMA CRST, BOE).
   * Justification: The selection of RCP 8.5 for chronic risks ensures that the bank's assessment of stranded assets accounts for a severe, but plausible, future climate trajectory. This helps to build resilience against worst-case scenarios and addresses regulatory expectations for robust climate risk assessments. The availability of robust scientific data for Sea Level Rise projections under the RCP 8.5 pathway further supports this choice.
 * Assumption 3.2.2: Exclusion of Heat Stress and Precipitation Stress from Direct Stranding Calculation
   * Definition: While Heat Stress and Precipitation Stress are critical components of physical climate risk, Heat Stress is considered for transition risk quantification in future analyses rather than for direct stranded asset calculation. Precipitation Stress is not considered for stranded assets, as its impact is implicitly captured by flood and storm risk assessments.
   * Rationale: This scope limitation is primarily due to methodological and data challenges in directly linking these perils to the specific outcome of "complete erosion of value" for mortgage collateral, as clearly defined for stranded assets. Heat stress primarily affects habitability, operational costs, and energy consumption, which may not directly lead to a 100% loss of property value in the same manner as inundation or structural damage from storms. Precipitation stress often exacerbates flood risk, making its direct impact inherently included in flood risk models.
   * Justification: This allows for a more streamlined and focused stranded asset methodology, concentrating resources on the most material and direct drivers of physical stranding as defined by the model. The bank's broader climate risk framework does consider these risks for other impact channels (e.g., operational risk, transition risk), and ongoing research and data development are being pursued to potentially integrate these into the SAA in future iterations if direct links to "complete erosion of value" become quantifiable.
 * Assumption 3.2.3: Exclusion of Insurance Benefits beyond 2030
   * Definition: Current insurance benefits are considered for markets where insurance is mandatory for flood and storm risk (e.g., Hong Kong, China, Australia, Netherlands) until 2030. From 2031 onwards, no insurance benefits are considered for stranded asset estimations.
   * Rationale: This decision reflects significant uncertainty around the future availability, affordability, and scope of insurance coverage in the face of escalating extreme climate events. Climate change disrupts the core principles on which insurance is built (quantifiable, diversified, and randomly occurring risks). Catastrophe risks, particularly flood risks, often do not meet these criteria, leading to issues like adverse selection and accumulation risk. Low demand for flood insurance can further reduce the size and diversity of the risk pool, leading to higher premiums and potentially market failure in the private insurance sector. Moreover, HKMA guidance (2023-24) explicitly states that banks should not assume any climate adaptation and mitigation measures (e.g., insurance coverage) in quantifying the impact under the Current Policies scenario, and renewal of existing insurance coverage after expiry should not be assumed. This aligns with findings from external reports (e.g., OECD report on Financial Management of Flood Risk discussing erosion in "Principles of Insurability," and BOE's papers on potential increases in flood insurance premia and difficulty in accessing finance for properties).
   * Justification: This conservative assumption mitigates the risk of underestimating exposure to stranded assets by not relying on uncertain future insurance coverage, particularly for the long-term tail risks that stranding addresses. This aligns with a prudent risk management approach and adheres to explicit regulatory guidance.
