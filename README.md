Ok there is a separate section (section 9, image attached) on model monitoring where i have to mention something like - 'we will be monitoring all the assumptions parameters and limitations. We will do all the periodic review and monitoring. For limitations we will keep an eye on new market update , new science, new literature.' refer to the assumptions and limitations and help me write this section


Here’s a clear and professional draft you can use for your section on Model Monitoring of Assumptions and Limitations, tailored based on the contents of your images and referencing Section 9 appropriately:

Monitoring of Assumptions and Limitations

All key assumptions and limitations outlined in this document (refer to Tables 7 and 8) are subject to regular review and monitoring as part of the model governance and validation framework.

We will actively monitor these assumptions—including climate scenario selection, mitigation thresholds, insurance assumptions, elevation proxies, and loss calculations—for relevance and accuracy based on emerging data, updated regulatory guidance, market developments, and advancements in climate science. Any significant changes in inputs, methodologies, or scenario families (e.g., changes to NGFS or IPCC scenario frameworks) will trigger a revalidation or update of model parameters through structured model risk processes.

For model limitations, including data gaps related to property attributes or the exclusion of hazards such as heat stress and precipitation stress, ongoing efforts are in place to capture and integrate improved data as they become available. This includes reviewing academic literature, new scientific findings, regulatory expectations, and internal data enhancements. Where risks are currently excluded due to quantification challenges (e.g., heat stress not explicitly modeled), future integration will be considered as quantification methods evolve.

This monitoring activity will follow the broader principles described in Section 9: Model Monitoring, which details the DQM (Data Quality Management) oversight, use of tools like GAME, and specific watch points (e.g., GMT tracking for LGD, extrapolation refinements for PD). In line with this, we will continue to use sensitivity analysis, expert judgment, and user testing to ensure model robustness and alignment with intended risk outcomes.

Let me know if you'd like a shorter version or one that fits better into a specific format (e.g., bullet points or compliance text).
Sure! Here's a table in the same format as the images you provided. It covers monitoring of assumptions and limitations in line with Section 9: Model Monitoring, and uses the same structure (Item, Description, Materiality/Impact, Monitoring Approach):

Table X: Monitoring of Assumptions and Limitations

Item	Description	Materiality / Impact	Monitoring Approach

Scenario Selection (RCP 8.5 / SSP5 8.5)	Use of high-end scenario to represent a conservative, worst-case trajectory	Leads to higher projected climate-related losses and conservative stranded asset estimates	Will be periodically reviewed in line with evolving NGFS scenario guidance and climate science. Adjustments will be made if new scenario pathways or consensus best-practices emerge.
Mitigant Thresholds	Thresholds (e.g., SOP levels, property age, distance to coast) define when assets are considered stranded	Affects number of stranded properties and magnitude of losses	Will be reviewed annually via expert workshops and sensitivity testing. Market-level data improvements or new regulatory inputs will inform recalibration.
Phase-out of Insurance Benefits Post-2030	Assumes insurance becomes unavailable after 2030	Significantly increases projected losses and reduces recoverable values	Monitoring of regulatory and market developments (e.g., HKMA, insurance trends) will continue. Review to be triggered upon publication of new guidance or data on market insurability.
Use of Property Type as Elevation Proxy	Uses property type as proxy for floor elevation	May misclassify flood exposure in some cases	Will be re-evaluated as granular elevation data becomes available. Coordination with property data providers and local market teams to validate assumptions.
Full Value Erosion Assumption	Entire outstanding value is assumed lost once property is stranded	Produces a conservative maximum loss estimate	Ongoing review against emerging damage data and loss modeling practices. If partial damage metrics become viable, methodology may be adjusted accordingly.
Limited Property Attribute Data	Incomplete availability of granular data like floor level or exposure	Affects precision of stranded classification and risk estimates	Market outreach and data collection initiatives are underway. Periodic updates to reflect any progress in data availability or vendor offerings.
Exclusion of Heat and Precipitation Stress	Heat and precipitation stress are not directly used in full-value stranding logic	May underestimate risks in regions where these perils dominate	Climate risk science developments and bank-wide climate integration efforts will be monitored. These perils will be incorporated when impact pathways and data reliability reach sufficient maturity.
DQM Monitoring (Section 9)	Covers use of global mean temperature (GMT) for LGD deterioration and PD extrapolation	Impacts climate calibration for LGD and treatment of non-CEM scorecard clients	Section 9 processes (GAME and validation use cases) will continue to track assumptions and inputs. Periodic updates will be made in response to emerging science (e.g., using regional temperatures) or new model developments.
