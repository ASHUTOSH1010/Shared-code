Ok there is a separate section (section 9, image attached) on model monitoring where i have to mention something like - 'we will be monitoring all the assumptions parameters and limitations. We will do all the periodic review and monitoring. For limitations we will keep an eye on new market update , new science, new literature.' refer to the assumptions and limitations and help me write this section


Here’s a clear and professional draft you can use for your section on Model Monitoring of Assumptions and Limitations, tailored based on the contents of your images and referencing Section 9 appropriately:

Monitoring of Assumptions and Limitations

All key assumptions and limitations outlined in this document (refer to Tables 7 and 8) are subject to regular review and monitoring as part of the model governance and validation framework.

We will actively monitor these assumptions—including climate scenario selection, mitigation thresholds, insurance assumptions, elevation proxies, and loss calculations—for relevance and accuracy based on emerging data, updated regulatory guidance, market developments, and advancements in climate science. Any significant changes in inputs, methodologies, or scenario families (e.g., changes to NGFS or IPCC scenario frameworks) will trigger a revalidation or update of model parameters through structured model risk processes.

For model limitations, including data gaps related to property attributes or the exclusion of hazards such as heat stress and precipitation stress, ongoing efforts are in place to capture and integrate improved data as they become available. This includes reviewing academic literature, new scientific findings, regulatory expectations, and internal data enhancements. Where risks are currently excluded due to quantification challenges (e.g., heat stress not explicitly modeled), future integration will be considered as quantification methods evolve.

This monitoring activity will follow the broader principles described in Section 9: Model Monitoring, which details the DQM (Data Quality Management) oversight, use of tools like GAME, and specific watch points (e.g., GMT tracking for LGD, extrapolation refinements for PD). In line with this, we will continue to use sensitivity analysis, expert judgment, and user testing to ensure model robustness and alignment with intended risk outcomes.

Let me know if you'd like a shorter version or one that fits better into a specific format (e.g., bullet points or compliance text).
