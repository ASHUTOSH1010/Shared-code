.3 Operating Boundaries
The Stranded Asset Analysis operates within defined boundaries concerning potential loss rates and portfolio thresholds. Currently, our loss rate for this year stands at 3.6%, while the MST 2024 loss rate was 3.4%. This methodological approach for identifying and quantifying stranded assets is considered appropriate as long as the total proportion of stranded assets at the Group level remains up to 5%. Should the percentage of stranded assets exceed this 5% threshold, the situation will be closely monitored, and a management judgment call will be exercised to assess and respond to the increased risk exposure.
