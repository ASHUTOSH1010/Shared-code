4. DQM INPUT DATA, MODEL METHODOLOGY & MODEL OUTPUT
This section describes the key elements of the input data, including data sources, time periods considered, data proxies, and data transformations. The data has been rigorously assessed to confirm its suitability and relevance for the overlay approach. Where applicable, the use of data proxies has been identified, justified, and thoroughly documented. Data transformation processes have been applied to Year-0 (actuals) BCRS data, and comprehensive data quality checks have been performed to ensure integrity.
4.1 DQM Input Data
The Stranded Asset Analysis relies on a diverse set of both internal and external data sources. The accuracy and reliability of the analysis are fundamentally dependent on the quality and consistency of this input data. While robust data acquisition and cleaning processes are in place, acknowledged data availability and usability challenges across various footprint markets are systematically managed, as detailed in Section 7.1.1.
Table 10 DQM Inputs
| # | Input Data | Description | Source | Remarks on Data Quality, Data Proxy, Data Transformation and/or Expert Judgement | Time Period & Data Availability | Files |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Internal Data | This category encompasses granular property-level information such as Property Age and Property Type, alongside essential mortgage details including loan amount, Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, outstanding balances, and precise geo-coordinates and Account IDs. These data points are foundational for identifying assets within the portfolio and for subsequent financial impact calculations. | Country Teams (for Property Age, Property Type) and WRB Mortgage Portfolio Data (Credit Risk Systems) | Data Quality: Rigorous sanity checks are performed to ensure the data is fit for use. A key challenge lies in the availability and usability of Property Age and Property Type data across specific markets (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, India), often leading to "not sourced" or "not usable" classifications, necessitating expert judgment. <br> Data Transformation: Raw property age and type data are cleaned and standardized using Python scripts, leveraging functions like clean_prop_type. The mortgage portfolio data, initially at a granular facility level, is processed and aggregated as needed for the analysis, involving "joining mortgage data with property details data". <br> Expert Judgment: Significant expert judgment is applied in addressing data limitations, guiding "best-effort" analysis in segments where complete data is unavailable. | Ongoing/As available (Property data); Quarterly/Monthly (Portfolio data) | Sourced Files: consolidated_prop_data.xlsx, property_types.xlsx, [Reference internal file paths for WRB Mortgage Portfolio Data if applicable] |
| 2 | External Climate Risk Data | This dataset provides granular, property-level climate risk assessments from specialized external vendors. It includes critical variables such as Country Code, Account Id, flood_risk_score_desc (e.g., "Extreme", "Low"), storm_risk_score_desc, quantitative sea_level_rise_rcp85y2100_value, flood_defense_sop (a score for flood defense effectiveness), distance_to_coast, and the outstanding_usd balance for each property. These external data points are fundamental to identifying and quantifying the portfolio's exposure to physical climate risks. | Data Strategy Team (External Vendor data) | Data Quality: Data acquired from external vendors undergoes a rigorous pre-processing phase by the dedicated Data Strategy team to ensure consistency and usability. <br> Data Transformation: Relevant numerical columns (e.g., heat_stress_index, sea_level_rise_rcp85y2100_value, flood_defense_sop, distance_to_coast, outstanding_usd) are converted to their appropriate numeric types using a Python function (convert_to_numeric). Account IDs are standardized and cleaned using a specific Python function (clean_actid) to facilitate accurate matching. A crucial step involves geo-spatial joining to precisely link property locations with their corresponding climate risk scores and values. | Annually/As updated | Sourced Files: WRBQ424_RCP_SSP_retail_data.xlsx |
| 3 | Climate Scenario Data | This input comprises the widely recognized Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), which serve as the foundation for long-term climate projections, specifically up to 2050. These scenarios describe plausible future climate and socioeconomic conditions. | IPCC / IEA | Data Quality: These data sources represent established scientific projections from authoritative bodies. <br> Data Proxy: For the purpose of this stress test, the RCP 8.5 pathway is utilized for chronic risk exposures to 2050. This choice reflects a conservative "worst-case" scenario, aligning with the objectives of a robust stress test. <br> Expert Judgment: A high degree of expert judgment is involved in selecting the most appropriate combination of RCP and SSP scenarios to define the relevant climate pathways for the analysis. | As published by IPCC/IEA | NA |
| 4 | Insurance Data | This category includes information regarding current insurance coverage status and any mandatory insurance requirements applicable to the mortgage portfolio. This data is leveraged for assessing short-term mitigation capabilities against climate risks. | Internal Insurance Policy Data | Data Quality: The completeness and accuracy of internal insurance policy data are verified. <br> Data Transformation: A specific logic is applied to recognize the benefits of insurance only until the year 2030, and exclusively in markets where insurance is explicitly mandatory (Hong Kong, China, UAE). This transformation reflects a prudent approach given long-term uncertainties. <br> Expert Judgment: There is a high level of expert judgment involved in the assumption that no insurance benefits will be applicable beyond 2031. This is driven by significant uncertainties regarding the future evolution of insurance premiums and the overall availability of coverage in the face of increasingly severe climate events, and the potential for a flood insurance market failure. | Annually/As updated | NA |
| 5 | Reference Mapping Files | These files are crucial for various lookup and categorization purposes within the analysis. Examples include mappings from Industry classifications to ISIC codes, and Country codes to broader Regional groupings, facilitating consistent data aggregation and reporting. | Climate Data Strategy (DS) Team; Static files (Internal) | Data Quality: Routine sanity checks are performed on these static reference files to ensure their accuracy and consistency. | NA (Annual for updates / One-time for initial setup) | Sourced Files: ISIC Mapping Clean.msg, ISIC_Industry_limit.csv, Country_Region_Map.csv |
4.2 DQM Methodology
The methodology for the Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) is designed to systematically identify and quantify potential losses within the mortgage portfolio resulting from the physical impacts of climate change. This involves assessing exposure to extreme physical risks and accounting for available mitigants, ultimately translating into management adjustments for Expected Credit Losses (ECL) or Loan Impairment (LI).
4.2.1 Methodology for Estimating Stranded Assets
The core of the SAA methodology lies in identifying "stranded assets" â€“ those mortgage-backed properties that are at high risk of significant value erosion due to physical climate hazards. This identification is based on exposures to "Extreme" risk categories across various physical risk types. The analysis primarily focuses on:
 * Acute Risks: Flood and Storm risks, assessed based on current conditions.
 * Chronic Risks: Sea Level Rise, projected under the conservative RCP 8.5 pathway as of the year 2050.
While Heat Stress and Precipitation Stress are recognized as critical climate risks at a broader group level, the current SAA is specifically tailored to focus on Flood, Storm, and Sea Level Rise for determining stranded assets. Heat stress is deemed more relevant for future quantification of transition risks, rather than direct asset stranding. Precipitation stress, given its indirect capture within the framework of flood and storm risks, is not a standalone factor for estimating stranded assets.
Crucially, an asset is designated as "stranded" only if it is exposed to these "Extreme" Acute (Flood or Storm) or Chronic (Sea Level Rise) risks AND fails to meet predefined mitigant criteria, as detailed in the following sections.
4.2.2 Assessment of Mitigants
Mitigants are essential factors that can reduce a property's vulnerability to physical climate risks. Different mitigants are considered depending on the specific risk type:
 * For Properties Exposed to Extreme Acute Risks (Flood or Storm):
   * Flood Defense Capability: Assessed using the Flood Defense SOP (Standard of Protection) score. Properties with a Poor Flood Defense (SOP \\le 20) are considered more vulnerable.
   * Age of Property: Older properties are generally more vulnerable. Properties constructed prior to 1970 are considered less resilient.
   * Type of Property: This serves as a proxy for the property's elevation or susceptibility to ground-level flooding. Properties expected to be on lower floors, such as Standalone Buildings, Village Type Houses, Villas, Bungalows, and Semi Detached properties, are considered more exposed. This approach was adopted due to the unavailability of direct data on property floor levels.
 * For Properties Exposed to Extreme Chronic Risks (Sea Level Rise):
   * Distance to Coast: Proximity to the coastline is a primary indicator for sea level rise risk. Properties located within 1 kilometer (\\le 1 \\text{km}) of the coast are considered more vulnerable.
Table 2: Mitigants Considered for Different Risk Types.
| Risk | Mitigant Variable | Mitigant Criteria | Stranded Asset Criteria* |
|---|---|---|---|
| Acute Risk (Flood/Storm) | Flood Defense SOP | High Flood Defense (SOP > 20) | Poor Flood Defense (SOP <= 20) |
|  | Age of Property | New Properties (Constructed after 1970) | Old Properties (Constructed prior to 1970) |
|  | Type of Property | Properties expected to be on higher floor like Condominiums, Apartments etc. | Properties expected to be on lower floors like Standalone Buildings, Village Type Houses, Villas, Bungalows, Semi Detached properties. |
|  | Insurance Benefits | 100% insurance benefits considered for markets where insurance is mandatory | Until 2030, markets where insurance is mandatory are considered for stranded assets estimation. From 2031, no insurance benefits are considered. |
| Chronic Risk (Sea Level Rise) | Distance to Coast | Far from the coast (distance > 1km) | Far from the coast (distance <= 1km) |
4.2.3 Phasing of Stranded Assets over the Projection Horizon
The manifestation of climate-related losses, particularly from physical risks, is expected to intensify over time. Based on expert panel discussions, it was agreed that the more material losses from stranded assets are likely to occur in the outer years of the projection horizon. To reflect this temporal progression, the distribution of management adjustments for stranded assets is determined by the cumulative rate of change in Global Mean Temperatures (GMT) profile.
 * For the "Current Policies" Scenario: In line with the scenario narrative, which anticipates a gradual increase in the intensity and frequency of physical risk events, management adjustments for both acute and chronic risks are applied starting from Year 2041.
 * For the "Tail Physical Risk" Scenario: This scenario implies more immediate and extreme shocks. Therefore, management adjustments for acute risks are applied from 2024. However, for chronic risks, the adjustments are still phased in from 2041. This distinction acknowledges that chronic risks, such as sea level rise, inherently manifest as a gradual accumulation over an extended period, requiring many years to produce significant effects, even under a tail risk scenario.
4.2.4 Treatment of Insurance in Stranded Asset Calculations (Post-2030)
While various physical mitigants (like flood defense SOP, property age/type, and distance to coast) are applied based on data availability, the consideration of insurance benefits in the Stranded Asset Analysis is time-bound and market-specific. Insurance benefits are recognized only until the year 2030, and exclusively in markets where property insurance is mandatory (Hong Kong, China, and UAE).
Rationale for Discontinuing Insurance Benefits from 2031:
Beyond 2031, the analysis prudently assumes that no insurance benefits will be applicable for stranded assets. This critical assumption is based on several key considerations, supported by internal discussions and external research:
 * Uncertainty in Future Premiums and Availability: There is significant uncertainty regarding how insurance premiums will evolve in response to escalating climate risks and whether coverage will remain available or affordable in highly exposed areas.
   * Anticipated increases in flood insurance premiums in flood-prone areas are expected to lead to a decrease in property values.
 * Disruption of "Principles of Insurability": For areas highly prone to recurrent severe events (e.g., floods), the fundamental principles of insurabilityâ€”which rely on quantifiable, diversified, and randomly occurring risksâ€”may be disrupted. Catastrophe risks, particularly flood risks, often do not meet these criteria. This can lead to insurers charging premiums beyond the willingness-to-pay of homeowners, ultimately resulting in a "flood insurance market failure" in the private market.
   * The OECD report on Financial Management of Flood Risk specifically discusses the erosion of "Principles of Insurability" and the likelihood of flood insurance market failure.
   * Low demand for flood insurance can further reduce the size and diversity of the insurance pool, leading to higher prices.
   * Low levels of insurance coverage can pressure governments to provide compensation, potentially creating a "disaster syndrome" where government aid further reduces demand for insurance.
 * Property Becoming "Unmortgageable": A foreseen decrease in the availability of flood insurance in most flood-prone areas could lead to properties becoming difficult to mortgage or even "unmortgageable".
 * Regulatory Guidance (HKMA CRST 2023-24): For conservative purposes, banks are advised not to account for climate adaptation and mitigation measures (including insurance coverage) in quantifying impact under the Current Policies scenario. Renewal of existing insurance coverage after expiry should not be assumed.
   * Internal discussions during the HKMA CRST exercise reinforced the view that property insurance benefit will only be available for Year 1, as the policy will not be available at renewal, and physical risk impact is expected to exacerbate over time.
   * Furthermore, even for claims lodged in Year 1, it is conservative to assume that numerous insurance claims linked to an extreme physical risk event will take a few years to settle.
   * It is noted that Mortgage Indemnity Policy (MIP) may not cover loss linked to stranded properties, or damages may need to be repairable and costs coverable from property insurance proceeds.
Application in Scenarios:
Due to these considerations, insurance benefits are applied only in the Tail Physical Risk scenario up to 2030, where losses appear earlier. They are not applied in the "Current Policies" scenario, as stranded assets are projected to emerge only after 2041 under that less severe pathway, coinciding with the period of assumed insurance unavailability. This approach aligns with recommendations from Stress Test Forum (STF) members, who advocated for recognizing existing insurance benefits in the initial years. It is assumed that 100% of stranded asset losses are covered by insurance until 2030, with an estimated benefit of approximately USD30m.
4.3 Model Methodology (cont.)
(This subsection is typically reserved for further elaboration on the model's technical aspects, approximations made, underlying assumptions beyond what's already covered, specific limitations, and the role of expert judgment in model development and application. While some of these aspects are touched upon in the DQM Assessment and the detailed methodology above, this section would provide a consolidated view if a dedicated part of the documentation exists for it.)
4.4 DQM Output
The primary and most critical output of the Stranded Asset Analysis is the quantitative assessment of potential financial losses stemming from physical climate risks. This assessment is directly translated into a management adjustment to Expected Credit Losses (ECL) / Loan Impairment (LI). This management adjustment serves as a vital input for:
 * Climate Risk Provisioning: Informing the bank's financial reserves against climate-related losses.
 * Capital Adequacy Discussions: Contributing to assessments like the ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process) capital add-on.
 * Regulatory Stress Testing: Providing key data points for exercises such as the HKMA Climate Risk Stress Test (CRST).
The analysis further provides a granular breakdown of the identified Stranded Assets (in USD billions), categorized by country and specific risk type (Acute vs. Chronic). For instance, the analysis projects material losses, exemplified by USD 2.7 billion for the MST 2025 scenario. These detailed outputs enable targeted risk management strategies and informed decision-making.
4.5 DQM Assessment
The Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) undergoes a rigorous Data Quality Management (DQM) assessment. This evaluation confirms its fitness for purpose, reflecting its high materiality, clear analytical objectives, and the inherent complexity of its underlying data and methodological framework.
Table: Detailed Reasoning for the DQM Assessment - Stranded Asset Analysis
| L1 Parameter | L1 Assessment | L2 Parameter | L2 Assessment | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Materiality | High | Reliance | High | High reliance as its output (management adjustment to ECL/LI) is used to inform key business decisions, climate risk provisioning, capital adequacy discussions (e.g., ICAAP capital add-on), and regulatory stress testing exercises (e.g., HKMA CRST). The identified losses are material (USD 2.7bn for MST 2025). |
|  |  | Purpose | High | The SAA serves a high-purpose function by explicitly quantifying tail physical climate risks (complete erosion of value) that are not fully captured by traditional credit risk models or PPI haircuts. This directly impacts financial provisioning and capital requirements for climate risk. |
|  |  | Coverage | High | Covers a significant portion of the Wealth and Retail Banking (WRB) portfolio, specifically residential mortgages, across key vulnerable markets including Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and India. This covers 59% of the WRB book. |
| Complexity | Low (Simple) | Network | Medium | The SAA is a standalone analytical tool that feeds directly into management adjustments for ECL/LI. It uses inputs from internal credit risk systems and external climate risk vendors (Data Strategy Team - e.g., flood_risk_score_desc, storm_risk_score_desc, sea_level_rise_rcp85y2100_value, flood_defense_sop, distance_to_coast, outstanding_usd from the uploaded file). While its output impacts financial metrics, it does not directly interact with complex internal capital or risk management models in a highly interconnected ne
