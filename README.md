4.3.3 DQM Assumptions and Limitations The DQM Assessment in Section 4.5 details the inherent limitations and assumptions of the Stranded Asset Analysis. Key assumptions include the conservative choice of the RCP 8.5 pathway for chronic risks, and the expert judgment applied in selecting mitigant thresholds. A significant assumption is the complete phase-out of insurance benefits from 2031 onwards due to anticipated market failures and regulatory conservatism, as detailed in Section 4.2.4. Data availability and usability challenges for property age and type across certain markets (e.g., Korea, Taiwan, India) are also acknowledged limitations, necessitating expert judgment for 'best-effort' analysis.
4.3.4 Use of Expert Judgment Expert judgment plays a critical role throughout the SAA process, compensating for data gaps and guiding strategic decisions. This is explicitly reflected in the Python script's logic where:
Scenario Selection: Expert judgment guided the selection of RCP 8.5 for chronic risks in the stress test scenario.
Mitigant Thresholds: The specific thresholds for Flood Defense SOP (\\le 20), Property Age (pre-1970), and Distance to Coast (\\le 1 \\text{km}) are based on expert consensus to define vulnerability.
Property Type Proxies: The use of 'Grounded' property types as a proxy for lower floors due to lack of elevation data is an application of expert judgment.
Insurance Treatment: The decision to cease factoring in insurance benefits from 2031 onward, driven by the anticipation of market failure and regulatory guidance, is a key application of expert judgment.
Handling of Missing Data: For countries where Property Age or Property Type data is 'not sourced' or 'not usable', expert judgment guides the 'best-effort' analytical approach, as captured in the script's conditional logic for flagging stranded properties.
4.4 DQM Output
The primary and most critical output of the Stranded Asset Analysis is the quantitative assessment of potential financial losses stemming from physical climate risks. This assessment is directly translated into a management adjustment to Expected Credit Losses (ECL) / Loan Impairment (LI). This management adjustment serves as a vital input for:
Climate Risk Provisioning: Informing the bank's financial reserves against climate-related losses.
Capital Adequacy Discussions: Contributing to assessments like the ICAAP (Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process) capital add-on.
Regulatory Stress Testing: Providing key data points for exercises such as the HKMA Climate Risk Stress Test (CRST).
The analysis further provides a granular breakdown of the identified Stranded Assets (in USD billions), categorized by country and specific risk type (Acute vs. Chronic). For instance, the analysis projects material losses, exemplified by USD 2.7 billion for the MST 2025 scenario. These detailed outputs enable targeted risk management strategies and informed decision-making.
Python Script Output Generation: The Python script explicitly generates several key outputs to summarize the results of the SAA.
It creates a pivot table (pivot_df) summarizing the outstanding_usd for the overall portfolio, segmented by 'Country Code'. This provides a high-level view of the portfolio's distribution.
The script also generates sensitivity tables, such as SOP_Sensitivity_Table and Coast_Distance_Sensitivity_Table, which show the total outstanding_usd (in millions) of stranded assets under different thresholds for Flood Defense SOP and Distance to Coast, respectively. These tables are crucial for understanding the robustness of the stranded asset figures to changes in key mitigant assumptions.
