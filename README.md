Certainly! Based on the example QC table you provided and the details of the Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) methodology we've discussed, here is a template for a QC table tailored for the SAA process.
This table outlines key quality control checks that should be performed to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the Stranded Asset Analysis output.
Stranded Asset Analysis (SAA) - Quality Control (QC) Table
| QC No. | QC Name | Description | Frequency | Source | Expected Output/Criteria | Evidence (Screenshot/Report Link) | Status (Pass/Fail) | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Input Data Completeness & Integrity | Verify that all required input fields (e.g., Account ID, Country Code, Property Age, Property Type, all climate risk scores/values, outstanding balance, geo-coordinates) are present, have valid data types, and meet defined quality thresholds. | Per Run | Raw Input Files (Internal & External) | - Missing values for critical fields < 5%. <br> - Numeric fields are correctly parsed. <br> - Text fields are standardized (e.g., no leading/trailing spaces, consistent casing). <br> - Total record count matches source files. | Input Data Quality Report | To be assessed | Highlight any fields with unusually high missing rates or unexpected data types. |
| 2 | Climate Hazard Mapping & Consistency | Confirm that raw numerical climate hazard values (e.g., sea level rise values, heat stress indices) are accurately mapped to their descriptive categories ('No Hazard', 'Low', 'Medium', 'High', 'Extreme') and are consistent with expected ranges. | Per Run | Processed Climate Risk Data | - All numerical values are correctly categorized. <br> - No unmapped or miscategorized entries. <br> - Distribution of hazard categories aligns with expectations. | Climate Hazard Mapping Log/Report | To be assessed | Review distribution of 'Extreme' hazards across regions/countries. |
| 3 | Mitigant Criteria Application Accuracy | Validate that the logic for applying all physical mitigants (Flood Defense SOP, Property Age, Property Type, Distance to Coast) is correctly executed, leading to accurate flagging of properties as vulnerable or mitigated. | Per Run | Intermediate Output (Mitigant Flags) | - SOP <= 20 correctly flags properties as 'Poor Flood Defense'. <br> - Properties constructed prior to 1970 correctly flagged as 'Old'. <br> - 'Grounded' property types are correctly identified. <br> - Properties distance <= 1km from coast are correctly flagged. | Sample Data Review (flagged properties) | To be assessed | Manual check of a few sample records for each mitigant. |
| 4 | Stranded Asset Identification Logic Validation | Verify that the final 'stranded' status for each property is correctly determined based on the combined logic of extreme risk exposure AND insufficient mitigants, as per the defined methodology. | Per Run | Final Output Data (Stranded Status) | - Total count of stranded assets aligns with expected logical conditions. <br> - Random sample check of stranded/non-stranded properties confirms correct classification. <br> - The core logic (Extreme Risk AND Failed Mitigant) is consistently applied. | Stranded Asset Summary Report | To be assessed | Focus on edge cases where a property might be borderline for stranding. |
| 5 | Total Loss Calculation & Financial Impact | Ensure that for all identified stranded assets, the estimated loss is precisely equal to their outstanding balance, reflecting the 100% Probability of Default (P) and 100% Loss Given Default (LGD) assumption. | Per Run | Final Output Data (Loss Calculation) | - For all is_stranded = True records, Calculated Loss = Outstanding Balance. <br> - Aggregated losses for stranded assets are accurate. | Financial Impact Report/Summary | To be assessed | Critical check for the core financial impact assumption. |
| 6 | Insurance Benefit Treatment Verification | Confirm that insurance benefits are correctly applied/excluded based on the phasing logic (e.g., only until 2030 for mandatory markets, no benefits from 2031 onwards for all markets). | Per Run | Final Output Data (Loss Calculation) | - No insurance benefits applied for losses post-2030. <br> - Insurance benefits only recognized for mandatory markets pre-2031. <br> - Overall benefit amount aligns with expected USD30m up to 2030 (if applicable). | Insurance Benefit Reconciliation Report | To be assessed | Ensure scenario-specific insurance treatment is correctly implemented. |
| 7 | Output Data Structure & Reporting Consistency | Confirm that the final output dataset (e.g., final_stranded_assets.csv) adheres to the predefined schema, has correct column names, and that key aggregated figures (e.g., total stranded exposure by country/region) are consistent for downstream reporting. | Per Run | Final Output File | - All required output columns are present with correct data types. <br> - Aggregated totals (e.g., total outstanding balance of stranded assets) match cross-checks. | Final Output Schema Validation Log | To be assessed | Ensure the output is ready for consumption by downstream systems/reports. |
